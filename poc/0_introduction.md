Welcome to the Proof of Concept component of the workshop.

You are a data scientist who is working with a power generation organization looking to predict power generation based on weather and other features. For this workshop, you will be able to put together your experience in:
* Data and feature engineering
* Modeling
* ML Ops model training and deployment
in order to first build a ML model predicting power generation and then operationalize the model as a REST API.
